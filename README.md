## About Me

- **Full Name:** Gwyneth D. Esperat
- **Nicename:** Nice / Gwen 
- **Major:** BS Computer Engineering
- **Year/Level:** 2nd Year
- **University:** Technological Institute of the Philippines

My leisure time often involves watching videos, with a particular focus on content related to cooking, drama, and dancingâ€”activities that allow me to explore different cuisines, immerse myself in compelling narratives, and appreciate the art of dance. As a Computer Engineering student, coding is not just a part of my academic journey but a passion, where I relish the challenge of solving problems and creating innovative solutions through code. Capturing moments through the lens in the realm of photography is another avenue where my creativity thrives, allowing me to freeze moments in time and convey emotions through visuals.
