## About Me

- **Full Name:** Gwyneth D. Esperat

I find solace and excitement in the world of literature, indulging in various genres of books, be it fiction, non-fiction, or poetry. Music is a constant companion in my life, and I appreciate the unique melodies that hold a special place in my heart. My leisure time often involves watching videos, with a particular focus on content related to cooking, drama, and dancing—activities that allow me to explore different cuisines, immerse myself in compelling narratives, and appreciate the art of dance. As a Computer Engineering student, coding is not just a part of my academic journey but a passion, where I relish the challenge of solving problems and creating innovative solutions through code. Capturing moments through the lens in the realm of photography is another avenue where my creativity thrives, allowing me to freeze moments in time and convey emotions through visuals.
